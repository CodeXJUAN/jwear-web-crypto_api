# JWEAR WEB + CRYPTO API

This is a project from university that I made with HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

This project is about a fictitious clothing brand called JWEAR, which I made thinking it would show the work I did and I think it worked.

In this project we were told to make a connection with an API, and the first few days I didn't know what to do, until I got tired and decided to use the free CoinGecko API.

CoinGecko is a real time cryptocurrency tracking platform, and I thought it would be a good idea to use their API for my project.

## Programming Languages

Since it's a website I went for the basics and used HTML, CSS and JavaScript, which was the only thing I knew.

## Folder structuring

For the folder structure, I thought it would be a good idea to separate everything in folders, like the .js files in the /JS folder, the .css files in the /CSS folder...

What I didn't like at all was not being able to put the photos in a database, I didn't have the time to do it.

But nothing happens because I have thought of making a second version in my free time of this Web but this time I will make it mobile application using React-Native and Tailwind, and if that was not enough I will make a connection with a database where to save photos and log in.
